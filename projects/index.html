      <p>
        I have had amazing opportunities to serve wonderful organizations both as a direct team member and as a consultant. Throughout the years, I have developed some fantastic relationships and recieved overwhlemingly positive feedback that I would like to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is always to enable business, reduce friction, and maximize productivity while securing the organization's environment. I provide Nordstrom-like, white-glove service through collaboration and parntership with executives and team members to ensure the understanding the "why" behind security and compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intentional diversity in my skillset has provided me the unique opportunity to be proficient in strategy, as well as, have great techincal skills. I enjoy working with and earning the trust of development teams while building strong application security programs.

        <quote>Chad has done outstanding work for us, creating a compliance and security infrastructure. More importantly, he was able to do it and have the company embrace compliance thru his spirit of kindness and willingness to be helpful. His approach is rare I have found in this world and it was very successful. Moreover, he willingly moved into other areas in which we had a vacuum, and filled them by leading some of our systems changes, educating our teams about transitioning to more of the Microsoft products and sunsetting applications that were redundant or not necessary.</quote>

        <quote>Chad's approach has been using a Servant's heart…being kind, respectful but being in service. He is not a "no" person but instead if a no, but" providing options and working along side the team to accomplish a commercial goal. Chad is a trusted advisor. I rely upon his knowledge and experience in many different areas and he performs at a very high level. His attitude of also willing to jump in, a strong work ethic, being helpful and respectful of others and seeing the enterprise at a high level is refreshing. He sets a new standard.</quote>
